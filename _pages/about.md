Learning is key for any type of intelligence. I love thinking about how human learns. And whether that is transferable to machines. Questions like `Why ML requires more data than human?`intrigue me.

My research interests are broadly learning a robust human representation, and aligning machine to human reasoning. Currently, I study reinforcement learning and dynamical systems. Sample-efficient [low-rank representation learning](https://github.com/DaiYijia02/lowrank-representation-deep-learning-recsys) for dynamical and unobserved user states, computationally-efficient [contextual logistic bandits](https://github.com/DaiYijia02/weighted-logistic-bandit) with ranking, and "algorithm-of-thoughts" styled [personalized question-understanding system](https://github.com/DaiYijia02/wise-person) are examples of what I am working on.
