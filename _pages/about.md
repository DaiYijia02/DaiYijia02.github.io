Learning is key for any type of intelligence. I love thinking about how human learns, and whether that is transferable to machines. Questions like `How do different sequential orderings of data and knowledge affect learning?` intrigue me.

My research interests include developing self-improvement mechanisms for large models, interpreting machine intelligence, and creating AI systems that enhance people's daily lives.

I'm fortunate to be working with Prof. [Sarah Dean](https://sdean.website), Prof. [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/), and Prof. [Jennifer Sun](https://jenjsun.com/) at Cornell. Currently, I study reinforcement learning, human-in-loop dynamical systems, and LLMs for scientific discovery. Sample-efficient [low-rank representation learning](https://github.com/DaiYijia02/lowrank-representation-deep-learning-recsys) for dynamical and unobserved user states, optimal learning of logistic bandits for recommendation systems, and LLMs for understanding decision trajectories are examples of what I work on.
