👋 ▫️ 👍 👀 ❕

Learning is key for any type of intelligence. I love thinking about how human learns, and whether that is transferable to machines. Questions like `Why ML requires more data than human?` intrigue me.

My research interests are interpreting machine intelligence, and aligning AI to human needs. I'm fortunate to be working with Prof. [Sarah Dean](https://sdean.website), Prof. [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/), and Prof. [Jennifer Sun](https://jenjsun.com/) at Cornell. Currently, I study reinforcement learning and human-in-loop dynamical systems. Sample-efficient [low-rank representation learning](https://github.com/DaiYijia02/lowrank-representation-deep-learning-recsys) for dynamical and unobserved user states is an example of what I work on.
